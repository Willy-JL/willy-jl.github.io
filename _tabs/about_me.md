Hi and welcome to my blog! I'm [**WillyJL**](https://linktr.ee/WillyJL) and I'm an 18 year old high school student from Italy. My tag-line (and my bio basically everywhere) is "CEO of Procrastination" because I tend to postpone everything way more than I should and always delay until the very last minute ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## Skills
Ever since my parents bought me an iPad when I was 10 years old I've always been very interested in everything related to tech and when in middle school we started learning the vary basics of C++ I quickly fell in love with the art of coding.

Even though I started off with C++ I decided to learn Python on my own from YouTube and in my free time I tried to code as much as I could. Today **Python** is still my language of choice and, even though I can't be considered an expert, I'm decently confident with my skills.

However Python isn't the only language I have worked with. I have also learned, though not to the same degree as Python, a few other languages. Mainly: **Lua**, when developing [Str8up Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/779), the first cheat menu for Cyberpunk 2077; **CSS**, when  making [Omega](https://github.com/Willy-JL/Omega-Theme), my own theme for the BetterDiscord client; **Redscript** (Swift-like syntax), when working on [Annoy Me No More](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/1512), a set of quality of life fixes for Cyberpunk 2077; **C++**, particularly when making [CP77 Discord RPC](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/986), which as the name suggest adds Discord rich presence support to Cyberpunk 2077, and [ModMover](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2325), a mod for Cyberpunk 2077 which moves other incorrectly installed mods to the correct location (note however that my knowlegdge of C++ is quite limited).

Finally, I consider myself a **tinkerer**, as in I can't stand it when something isn't exactly the way I want it or when something doesn't work, and because of that I'll try to take it upon myself to "fix" it. For this reason over the years I have worked with a considerable amount of languages: **HTML**, **AutoHotKey**, **JavaScript**, **Java**, **YML**, **XML**, **JSON** and others.

## Other Skills
Other than coding I have dabbled with some other stuff, like for example I know my way around Photoshop (somewhat), I can manage with relatively basic video editing in both Vegas and Premiere, I can work with HTTP requests and APIs and I can put together simple game asset mods, provided the tools are already available.

## Other Interests
In conclusion I'd like to talk about some of the other stuff I do in my free time. First of all I love music, and that includes almost all genres, from Lil Peep to Lil Darkie and from Eurobeat to Metal. And of course, I've spent my fair share of time playing videogames, notably Minecraft, GTA5, Forza Horizon 1, 3 and 4, Need for Speed Heat, Cyberpunk 2077, Satisfactory, Fortnite (yes, I know, you can restrain yourself), Rainbow 6 Siege and Horizon Zero Dawn.
