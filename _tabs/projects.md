# Actual Projects

<br>

![Soundy icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Willy-JL/Soundy/main/resources/icons/icon.png){: style="width: 33%; max-width: 200px;" .left}
## [**Soundy**](https://github.com/Willy-JL/Soundy)
Soundy is a minimal **media controller and visualizer**. It shows the currently playing track along with it's author and the album art, which also influences the colors of the rest of the interface. It features your usual play/pause, skip, repeat, shuffle and time scrubber controls, along with **Discord rich presenc**e support. It hooks into Windows' internal API and because of this **nearly all media players** (including most browsers) **are supported**.

## [**A.L.T.I.E.R.A.**](https://github.com/Willy-JL/ALTIERA-Bot)
A.L.T.I.E.R.A., also known as Alt bot, is a **custom Discord bot** I wrote for the **Cyberpunk 2077 modding servers**. The main feature is the user **experience system** that tracks level (any kind of message), cred (messages by modders in modding channels) and assistance (messages in help channels). That however is not the only feature: it also allows you to **give reputation** to other users, receive a **daily reward**, custom server **join** and user **level-up notification** messages and a few other commands. Also the bot is **custom themed** for the futuristic and cyberpunky atmosphere in the servers.

## [**AnimateMyEmojis**](https://github.com/Willy-JL/Animate-My-Emojis)
AnimateMyEmojis is a **Discord bot** that allows **non nitro users** to use **animated emojis** in servers. How it works is that when a message is sent it checks for emoji names that are not actually being displayed as emojis, and if it finds some it will delete the message and resend it 1:1 though a webhook (created automatically) with the same user's name and profile picture but with the emojis converted and animated. This bot also features **"yoinking" emojis**, which allows you to add other server's emojis to your own server.

![Lifeless icon](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/741226265100681229/782016206810775582/unknown.png){: style="width: 33%; max-width: 200px; border-radius: 50%;"" .right}
## **Lifeless SelfBot**
Lifeless is a **selfbot** for the Discord platform. It's purpose is to enhance your chatting experience with a wide range of cool and useful commands. The aim is a very **stable and reliable** program with **exclusive features** and that is easy to setup and use. For the time being this is a **work in progress**, with no ETA. This will be closed source and paid (lifetime, no subscriptions, likely 5€ or 10€).

<br>

![Omega icon](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/741226265100681229/864969847657201745/omega.png){: style="width: 33%; max-width: 200px; border-radius: 50%;"" .left}
## [**Omega**](https://github.com/Willy-JL/Omega-Theme)
Omega is my very own **custom theme** for the **BetterDiscord** client. I decided to create it because I simply couldn't quite find the theme I wanted and so I started making my own. Omega keeps Discord's original feeling, but makes the whole interface **slightly darker** and features a consistent color scheme with stunning **gradients**, which by default are blue to purple. It takes some design inspiration from Nocturnal, but was written by myself for the most part.

<br>

![InstaDownloader icon](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/741226265100681229/864962351480569866/118063983_325062525308988_6769172755963192430_n.png){: style="width: 33%; max-width: 200px; border-radius: 50%;"" .right}
## [**InstaDownloader**](https://github.com/Willy-JL/InstaDownloader)
InstaDownloader is an **Instagram bot** that replies to direct mesages (aka DMs) with **direct links to the media** you sent. This way it is possible to easily **download images and videos** from Instagram. Unfortunately, just like all other project similar in concept, this is largely subject to **rate limits** and shadow bans due to its design. As of right now I am not actively maintaining the code base and the bot itself is not active (my instance is not running, I don't know if there are mirrors). If I come back to the project I will implement a websocket system to circumvent rate limits and better mimick the web client.

![F95Checker icon](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/741226265100681229/864987647628541952/f95checker.png){: style="width: 33%; max-width: 200px; border-radius: 50%;"" .left}
## [**F95Checker**](hhttps://github.com/Willy-JL/F95Checker)
F95Checker is an **update checker and manager tool** for **NSFW games** on the **F95Zone** platform. Unlike other similar tools, it aims to be **easy to setup and use**, without bloating the user interface with complex features and unwanted behavior. For each game you can see the banner image, description, changelog, current version, development status and you have a button to launch it if you have it installed. It also features an **alert and inbox checker**, to keep you up to speed on what has been happening on the forum, and a **background mode**, which will notify you of game updates and alerts every 15 minutes.

# Cyberpunk 2077 Mods

<br>

## [**Better Minimap**](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/634)
Better Minimap was the first mod to address the lingering issue of **GPS zoom**, causing you to not see upcoming turns. The mod features 4 zoom settings for vehicles and 4 for on foot navigation, along with some **aesthetic options**. You can either use the presets or install using the installer, which gives you more customization options.

<br>

## [**Str8up Menu**](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/779)
Str8up was the **first cheat menu** to come to Cyberpunk 2077. Thanks to Cyber Engine Tweaks (mod framework and console addon) including ImGUI it was finally a viable option to make a user interface within the game and Str8up menu was one of the first to make use of this and it brought a much needed **GTA-style mod menu** to Cyberpunk 2077.

## [**CP77 Discord RPC**](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/986)
When Cyberpunk 2077 first released I was personally quite shocked to find out that such a massive game didn't include any kind of **rich presence support for Discord**, and because of this I felt the need to incorporate it myself. The first attempt was quite bumpy as it required a parallel Python process to update the presence info, but later rewriting it in C++ and integrating it as an ASI mod made it much more **stable** and gave it a **nearly native feel**.

## [**Annoy Me No More**](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/1512)
In Cyberpunk 2077 there are many **annoying and simply stupid limitations and behaviors** that you cannot change in any way, and when with the release of Redscript it was finally possible to easily edit the game's core scripts I rushed to make some of what I considered to be the most **needed fixes and improvements**.

## [**Mod Mover**](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2325)
With many different creators making awesome mods it was bound to happen that someone would make a great mod but **package** it **incorrectly**, and while to most users this is not a big deal, in some cases it can be, like for example installing mods with Vortex mod manager will simply not load the mod because it will end up in the **wrong folder**. Mod Mover aims to fix that by **moving** (aka renaming, takes no time at all) **the incorrectly installed mods to their appropriate location** when the game is started, and to optionally move them back when the game is closed.
