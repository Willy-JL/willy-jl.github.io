## Soundy
Soundy is a minimal media controller and visualizer. It shows the currently playing track along with it's author and the album art, which also influences the colors of the rest of the interface. It features your usual play/pause, skip, repeat, shuffle and time scrubber controls, along with Discord rich presence support.
