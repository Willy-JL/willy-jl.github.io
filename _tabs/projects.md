## [**Soundy**](https://github.com/Willy-JL/Soundy)
Soundy is a minimal media controller and visualizer. It shows the currently playing track along with it's author and the album art, which also influences the colors of the rest of the interface. It features your usual play/pause, skip, repeat, shuffle and time scrubber controls, along with Discord rich presence support. It hooks into Windows' internal API and because of this nearly all media players (including most browsers) are supported.

## [**A.L.T.I.E.R.A.**](https://github.com/Willy-JL/ALTIERA-Bot)
A.L.T.I.E.R.A., also known as Alt bot, is a custom bot I wrote for the Cyberpunk 2077 modding Discord servers. The main feature is the user experience system that tracks level (any kind of message), cred (messages by modders in modding channels) and assistance (messages in help channels). That however is not the only feature: it also allows you to give reputation to other users, receive daily a reward, custom server join and user level-up notification messages and a few other commands. Also the bot is custom themed for the futuristic and cyberpunky atmosphere in the servers.

## [**AnimateMyEmojis**](https://github.com/Willy-JL/Animate-My-Emojis)
AnimateMyEmojis is a Discord bot that allows non nitro users to use animated emojis in servers. How it works is that when a message is sent it checks for emoji names that are not actually being displayed as emojis, and if it finds some it will delete the message and resend it 1:1 though a webhook (created automatically) with the same user's name and profile picture but with the emojis converted and animated. This bot also features "yoinking" emojis, which allows you to add other server's emojis to your own server.

## [**Lifeless SelfBot**]
Lifeless is a selfbot for the Discord platform. It's purpose is to enhance your chatting experience with a wide range of cool and useful commands. The aim is a very stable and reliable program with eclusive features and that is easy to setup and use. For the time being this is a work in progress, with no ETA. This will be closed source and paid (lifetime, no subscriptions, likely 5€ or 10€).
